## Python Scripts

A collection of small, beginner-friendly Python scripts for learning and experimenting with basic programming concepts. I wrote a few of these script during the CS50P course and purely for educational purpose, while a few demonstrate offensive-security concepts for learning defensive and testing skills. Use responsibly.
