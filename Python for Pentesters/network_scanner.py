##### ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanner can be monitored or blocked on the target organization. On the other hand, systems can be configured to not respond to ICMP requests. These are the main reasons why using the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to identify targets on the local network is more effective
```
from scapy.all import *
from scapy.layers.l2 import Ether
from scapy.layers.l2 import ARP

interface = "eth0"
ip_range = "10.10.X.X/24"
broadcastMac = "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"

packet = Ether(dst=broadcastMac)/ARP(pdst=ip_range)

ans, unans = srp(packet, timeout=2, iface=interface, inter=0.1)

for send, receive in ans:
	print(receive.sprintf(r"%Ether.src% - %ARP.psrc%"))
```
