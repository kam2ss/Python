##### The following code will build a simple tool that performs directory enumeration on a web server. It reads a list of directory names from a file called 'wordlist.txt' and attempts to access each directory by sending an HTTP request to the specified server
```
# requests module has several built-in methods to make http requests to specified URI 
# using GET, POST, etc 

import requests
import sys

with open("wordlist.txt") as file:
	for line in file:
	    dir_name = line.strip()
		dir_enum = f"http://{sys.argv[1]}/{dir}.html"
		r = requests.get(dir_enum)
		if r.status_code == 404:
			pass  
		else:
			print("Valid directory:", dir_enum)
```

#### TryHackMe solution
```
import requests
import sys

sub_list = open("wordlist.txt").read()
directories = sub_list.splitlines()

for dir in directories:
	dir_enum = f"http://{sys.argv[1]}/{dir}.html"
	r = requests.get(dir_enum)
	if r.status_code==404:
		pass
	else:
		print("Valid directory:" ,dir_enum)
```
